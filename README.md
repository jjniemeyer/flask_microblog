# Flask Microblog

This project is for getting an understanding of the structure of a flask app.
The code is from the [Flask Mega Tutorial](http://blog.miguelgirnberg.com)
I will likely customize this app a little but I'm primarily keeping it around for reference and practice with containerization and deployment.
